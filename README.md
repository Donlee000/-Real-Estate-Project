#### Data Cleaning and Preperation 

During the initial phase of preparing the data, we undertook a series of essential tasks to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. These tasks involved several key activities, including:

1. Extracting and importing data directly from a website using web scraping techniques.
2. Addressing and managing any missing or incomplete values in the dataset to maintain its integrity and reliability.
3. Conducting a thorough cleaning and reformatting process to standardize the data structure and improve its usability for subsequent analysis.
